Time Travel Trivia 

Time Travel Trivia is a quiz game that challenges players' knowledge of history. The game includes one category: General History. This category contains 25 questions. Each question presents four potential answers, and players must choose the correct answer within a 15 second time limit. The interactive experience is enhanced through sounds and colors that indicate whether an answer is right or wrong. The game is structured into three main components: The main menu page, question/answer page, and results page. The menu page displays the title and a button players can click to begin the game. Upon completion, players are met by a results page which displays how many questions the player got right, along with a button players can click to return to the menu.
